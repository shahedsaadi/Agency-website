# Agency-website


# Overview :
web design agency is a quite simple website with big block text telling people what they do and just simple clean design by CSS.
The website actually scales responsively. When it's displayed on a smaller screen, the blocks in the website change and are centered and responsive to make better use of the screen real estate.

So instead of having the blocks side by side such as in the original design, when the screen size is a certain size, they stack on top of each other. As you can see in the below image.
